> Remember that a man's name is to him the sweetest and most important sound in the English language.

> **Dale Carnegie** ([How to Win Friends and Influence People](http://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People-ebook/dp/B003WEAI4E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1391492373&sr=8-1&keywords=how+to+win+friends+and+influence+people))

nombre automatically adds the first name of the person you are replying to on Twitter to the Tweet.

## Background

I'm surprised more people haven't read Carnegie's book. It's the top book on[ Y Combinator's recommended library](http://ycombinator.com/lib.html). 

For years I struggled building an audience. But things are clicking now with my writing and my project [Draft](http://draftin.com) to help people [write better](http://draftin.com).

One helpful technique I figured out is simply getting better at interacting with more people on Twitter. And I like using people's first names in communication with them. People are blind to their Twitter handles. Who the hell is @natekontny? I prefer Nate or Nathan. I think most other people prefer their own name too. 

But if you use Twitter in any volume, typing people's first names can be quite a task, and it's prone to typos. 

nombre was made to automate just a little bit of the typing. 
 
## Installation

nombre is a Chrome extension that runs only while you are viewing Twitter.com. [Click here to access the Draft Chrome extension.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/draft/amlbbbgcijmiooecobhkjblcdkjldmdk)

There's not much to it. After installation, click Reply on a Tweet in your stream, and their first name will automatically be populated in the Tweet box. 

P.S. [**I'd love to meet you on Twitter: here**](http://twitter.com/natekontny).
