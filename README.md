nombre is a Chrome extension that creates a new menu item in Twitter to "Reply with name".

## Background

For years I struggled building an audience. But I'm very blessed today to have things clicking with my writing and my project [Draft](http://draftin.com) to help people [write better](http://draftin.com). One helpful technique I figured out to grow my Twitter audience is simply getting better at interacting with people on Twitter. 

(I'm surprised more people haven't read Carnegie's book. It's the top book on[ Y Combinator's recommended library](http://ycombinator.com/lib.html).) 

I like using people's first names in communication with them. People are blind to their Twitter handles. Who is "@natekontny"? I prefer Nate or Nathan. I think most other people prefer their own name. 

But if you use Twitter in any volume, typing people's first names can be quite a task, and it's prone to typos. 

nombre was made to automate a little bit of the typing. 
 
## Installation

nombre is a Chrome extension that runs only while you are viewing Twitter.com. [Click here to install it](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nombre/mplclfkbgibkpdclilboknbdechghgpi).

After installation, use the "More" menu in a Twitter post you want to reply to. Click "Reply with name", and their first name will automatically be populated in the Tweet box. 

There's not much to it, but it saves a bunch of typing. I hope you find it useful.

P.S. [**I'd love to meet you on Twitter: here**](http://twitter.com/natekontny).
